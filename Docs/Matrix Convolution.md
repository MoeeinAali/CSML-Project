# Convolution Matrix Assembly Code

This assembly code calculates the convolution matrix of two input matrices (`mat1` and `mat2`) and stores the result in the `mat3` matrix. The matrices are read from the user as input, and the final result is displayed using the `write_float` and `write_char` functions.

## Prerequisites

- The code assumes the availability of functions `read_float`, `read_uint`, `write_float`, `write_uint`, and `write_char` for input/output operations.
- Ensure that the appropriate input functions (`read_float`, `read_uint`) and output functions (`write_float`, `write_uint`, `write_char`) are properly linked.

## Usage

1. Provide the dimensions `n` and `m` as inputs.
2. Input the elements of the first matrix (`mat1`) and the second matrix (`mat2`) using the `read_float` function.
3. The code will calculate the convolution of the matrices and store the result in the `mat3` matrix.
4. The result will be displayed using the `write_float` and `write_char` functions.

## Code Structure

- `asm_main`: The main entry point of the program.
- Input: Reads dimensions `n` and `m`, and inputs matrices `mat1` and `mat2`.
- Convolution: Performs matrix convolution and stores the result in `mat3`.
- Output: Displays the result using the `write_float` and `write_char` functions.

## Matrix Definitions

- `mat1`: Input matrix 1.
- `mat2`: Input matrix 2.
- `mat3`: Resultant convolution matrix.

## Data Section

- `vec`: Vector used for input operations.
- `n`: Variable to store the dimension of the matrices.
- `m`: Variable to store the dimension of the matrices.

## Note

- Ensure proper linking with the required input/output functions.
- The code assumes the availability of the specified functions and proper handling of input matrices.
- Modify the code as needed for specific use cases or integration with higher-level languages.
