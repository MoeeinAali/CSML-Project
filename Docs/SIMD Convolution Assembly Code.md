# SIMD Convolution Assembly Code

This assembly code is designed to calculate the convolution matrix in parallel using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, leveraging vectorized operations for enhanced performance.

## Prerequisites
- The code relies on external functions such as `printf`, `read_float`, `read_uint`, `write_float`, `write_uint`, and `write_char` for input/output operations.
- Ensure proper linking with the required input/output functions.

## Code Overview
- The main entry point is `asm_main`.
- **Input:** Reads dimensions `n` and `m`, and inputs matrices `mat1` and `mat2`.
- **Convolution:** Performs parallelized convolution using SIMD instructions and stores the result in `mat3`.
- **Output:** Displays the result using the `write_float` and `write_char` functions.

## Matrix Definitions
- `mat1`: Represents Input matrix 1.
- `mat2`: Represents Input matrix 2.
- `mat3`: Represents the Resultant convolution matrix.

## Data Section
- `vec`: This vector is utilized for input operations.
- `n`: A variable designated to store the dimension of the matrices.
- `m`: A variable designated to store the dimension of the matrices.

## Note
- Ensure proper linking with the required input/output functions.
- The code assumes the availability of the specified functions (`printf`, `read_float`, `read_uint`, `write_float`, `write_uint`, `write_char`) for input/output operations.
- Make adjustments to the code as necessary to accommodate specific use cases or integration with higher-level languages.
